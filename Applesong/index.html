				<h2>Writing Your Song</h2>
				<p>Producer Jae Deal begins his songwriting process at the piano, trying out different lyrics and melodies before putting it down on paper. Sometimes, the whole process of creating a song can be painstaking, with many tossed drafts. This time around, the track came together quickly with easy inspiration.</p>
				<p>Here Jae uses IK Multimedia's iRig Keys I/O, combining a 25-key MIDI controller with an integrated audio interface to give you an all-in-one music production workstation that you can take anywhere.</p>

					<h2>Developing Your Sound</h2>
					<p>After the bones of the music are in place, Jae turns his attention to the heart of the music -- the beat track that will drive the music forward and gives a song its signature sound.</p>
					<p>Jae uses LogicPro, a complete collection of sophisticated creative tools for songwriting, beat making, editing, and mixing. Logic Pro includes a massive collection of instruments, effects, loops and samples, providing a complete toolkit to create amazing-sounding music.</p>

					<h2>Collaboration is Key</h2>
					<p>When the song is ready, Jae works with artist Anya V to workshop the song so that it fits her voice. This part of the process is really inspiring, where artists hear each other's ideas and begin adjusting the music building off of feedback</p>
					<p>Anya and Jae are listening to music using a Beats sound system, a stereo active 2-way crossover system that creates an optimized sound field for dynamic range and clarity across all genres of music. Tweeter and woofer separation uses the same acoustic mechanics found in professional recording studios around the world.

					<h2>Recording the Track</h2>
					<p>When workshopping is done, Anya V records the new track with Jae in the production sound booth. Here is where the music begins to take real shape, and the artist finds room for further expression.</p>
					<p>Anya V is recording with the  Shure MOTIV MV88 Digital Stereo Condenser Microphone. The mid-side microphone element is mounted to a unique 90-degree hinge with built-in rotation that allows for highly flexible microphone position, even in video applications.

				<div class="page">
					<h2>Refining the Process</h2>
					<p>Recording is a process of constant refining. After initial recording sessions, Anya V and Jae record cover tracks and multiple versions to get the best possible version of the newly created song for future mixing.</p>
					<p>Anya V is wearing Apple's Airpod Pro Max headphones, provising high-fidelity audio. The Apple-designed driver delivers high-fidelity playback with ultra-low distortion across the entire audible range.</p>

				<div class="page">
					<h2>Mixing the Sound</h2>
					<p>When the recording sessions are over, Jae takes the tracks back to the chopping block, mixing the sound, adding new beat tracks, boosting up the audio.</p>
					<p>Jae uses the Pioneer Pro DJ Mixer. Its 4.3-inch customizable touch screen gives all the information you need. Browse tracks, check waveforms, and dynamically change the texture of the music with TOUCH FX.</p>
