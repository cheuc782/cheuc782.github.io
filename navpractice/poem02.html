      </p>The way my father talks you must've wanted<br>
                  to play piano too: I imagine</p>

      </p>your sugared ankles at the pedals, gold</p>

      </p>shutter of the bench like my grandfather's<br>
                  camera. After he snaps, you go on</p>

      </p>smiling at the ocean, breaking water,</p>

      </p>beachcombers. Fossils rippling like keys<br>
                  where your toes sink. Because music</p>

      </p>is a kind of drowning, you don't hear</p>

      </p>the pearl oyster crack open or your grown<br>
                  son's mumbling piano. I only see</p>

      </p>how young you are, how the light loves<br>
                  you. My father won't say the rest:</p>

      </p>gold flower in your mouth. Torn mouth<br>
                  of a sugar sack. Lampshades. Your</p>


      </p>darkened room. What can't disappear in water?</p>
