<p class="poemtitle">The Year I Was Born, My Grandfather Died<br>
by Lisa Low</p>

<p>Memory revises me.<br>
-Li-Young Lee, from "Furious Versions"</p>


<p>Each time you tell the story I am<br>
younger and younger. Soon</p>

<p>the back door will unlatch<br>
its flapping moths. Dandelions</p>

<p>melting in the valley, our<br>
acre yard without a split-level</p>

<p>house. I will be small enough<br>
for my father to lift me from</p>

<p>the car, sleeping. I won't know<br>
your father if we go back even</p>

<p>this far, after you gave up<br>
incense, its lit and rotting wand.</p>
